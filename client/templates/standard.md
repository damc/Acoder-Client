# Description

[
Describe the task that you want Acoder to accomplish here.

Example:
Change the forms in the HTML template file to use tables instead of divs.
]

# Change

[
List all the files that Acoder might need to change in order to accomplish the task here.

Don't insert too many files here because Acoder has short memory. The less files are here (and the shorter they are), the better job it will do. If the cumulative length of the description and the included files is too long, then you will see an error message. If the task requires including too many files in order to be accomplished, then split that task into few smaller tasks and execute those smaller tasks consecutively.

Each file should be in a separate line. You need to pass the aboslute path to the file.

Example:
/home/damian/Projects/SelfControl/src/Controller/Front/IndexController.php
/home/damian/Projects/SelfControl/src/Controller/Front/RegistrationController.php
]

# Look

[
List all the files that Acoder might need to look at (in other words, the files that it needs to be aware of) in order to accomplish the task here.

You don't need to repeat the files that are under "change" - those files will be automatically visible to Acoder.

Acoder can see only the files that you list under "change" or "look". The rest of the files is invisible to Acoder.

Don't insert too many files here because Acoder has short memory. The less files are here (and the shorter they are), the better job it will do. If the cummulative length of the description and the included files is too long, then you will see an error message. If the task requires including too many files in order to be accomplished, then split that task into few smaller tasks and execute those smaller tasks.

Example:
/home/damian/Projects/SelfControl/src/Controller/Front/SecurityController.php
/home/damian/Projects/SelfControl/config/packages/security.yaml
